								<p>
								We are experienced developers and system engineers with solid expertise acquired during work for major companies in travel and betting industry. For years we have been dealing daily with large scale heteregenous online systems with strict performance and availability requirements. Those systems process tens thousands online transactions per second in peak hours. They are spread across few data centers and cloud vendors, running on a few thousands of machines, hundreds of databases, queues and dozens of load balancers. Adding nontrivial business needs makes the entire environment complex and challenging.
